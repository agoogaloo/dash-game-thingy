# Dash Game Thingy



## About:

- this is a game I'm currently making where your only movement is dashing a set distance 
- it still in development so it is pretty bad right now 
- if you have suggestions or find bugs or something like that it would be cool if you e-mailed me at aguy24601@gmail.com
- can also be downloaded from google drve at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZxgdZufnqDnJOpfGvBBCgn2T6iaTX_lA?usp=sharing


## Patch notes:

### 0.0.1
- fixed frame rate accuracy 
- hitbox is lower while dashing
- you can update just the code so you don’t need to reinstall java everytime
- dashing animation is different
- you don’t need to click on the water tile to start the game because that doesn’t make sense 

### 0.1.0
- new, better tileset that isn’t top-down and weird
- a background. I guess there sort of was one before but this one’s better
- new level layout
- you can attack things 
- bats that can both attack you and be attacked with knockback
- an icon so you can look at the indestructible Cell Wall Man in all his beauty whenever you start the game
- the camera stops whenever you reach the edge of the map. I had it before but forgot to implement it
- there isn’t a gap when you dash into walls on the right
- probably several other things I forgot


### 0.2.0
- dash attacks
- a pause menu/level select
- levels
- a different background so you can actually see your attacks
- hitboxes aren’t visible anymore (unless you want them to)
- a different icon
- changed some hit stun and knockback on the attacks
- you can die if you get hit 3 times
- tiles connect to each other better so everything looks more fluid


## Things coming to a update near you so potential spoilers I guess:
- sounds
- saves
- only being able to jump on the ground
- upgrades
- main area that you always return to
- actually good levels and enemies
- projectiles
- other things I forgot to mention
