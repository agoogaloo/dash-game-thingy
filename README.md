# dash-game-thingy
##About:

- this is a game I'm currently making where your only movement is dashing a set distance 
- it still in development so it is pretty bad right now 
- if you have suggestions or find bugs or something like that it would be cool if you e-mailed me at aguy24601@gmail.com
***
##patch notes:

###0.0.1
-fixed frame rate accuracy 
-hitbox is lower while dashing
-you can update just the code so you don’t need to reinstall java everytime
-dashing animation is different
-you don’t need to click on the water tile to start the game because that doesn’t make sense 
***
###0.1.0
-new, better tileset that isn’t top-down and weird
-a background. I guess there sort of was one before but this one’s better
-new level layout
-you can attack things 
-bats that can both attack you and be attacked with knockback
-an icon so you can look at the indestructible Cell Wall Man in all his beauty whenever you start the game
-the camera stops whenever you reach the edge of the map. I had it before but forgot to implement it
-there isn’t a gap when you dash into walls on the right
-probably several other things I forgot
***
##Things coming to a update near you so potential spoilers I guess:

-knockback that doesn’t send you through walls
-different up,down,and dashing attacks
-tiles that fit together properly attach so there isn’t random gaps everywhere
-different levels
-sounds
-menus
-saves
-game overs/being able to die
-only being able to jump on the ground
-other things I forgot to mention
